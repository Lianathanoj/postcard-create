# postcard-create

Angular app skeleton to be forked and used for training.

## Dependencies

All dependencies are managed through `npm`, so you only need to run:

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Running

This app uses [Beefy](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/beefy) as a development server that serves up `public/index.html` and compiles the Javascript through [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) on the fly so it's easy to make changes and see the results during development. To start the server, just run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

## Testing

This app uses [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) as a test runner, and it uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as the testing framework. To run the tests, just run:

```bash
$ npm test
```
