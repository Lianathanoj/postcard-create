# postcard-create

Angular app skeleton to be forked and used for training.

## Dependencies

All dependencies are managed through `npm`, so you only need to run:

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Running

This app uses [Beefy](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/beefy) as a development server that serves up `public/index.html` and compiles the Javascript through [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) on the fly so it's easy to make changes and see the results during development. To start the server, just run:

```bash
$ npm start
```
